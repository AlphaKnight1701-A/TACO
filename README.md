# 🌮 Taco Arm Robot

The Taco Arm Robot is a programmable robotic arm built using the LEGO Robot Inventor Hub and controlled via PyBricks MicroPython. It can perform precise movements, respond to distance sensor input, and execute coordinated actions such as gripping, lifting, and rotating — all inspired by the goal of grabbing and serving a “taco”! 🌮🤖

🚀 Features

Angle-based movement control for base, shoulder, and elbow joints.

Gripper control (open/close) using a motor with stall detection.

Ultrasonic distance sensing for object detection.

Predefined movement routines for demonstration or testing.

Fully written in PyBricks MicroPython, compatible with LEGO® Robot Inventor.
